A man must know his destiny.. if he does not recognize it, then he is 
lost. By this I mean, once, twice, or at the very most, three times,

fork in the road he should take, if he has the guts, he will take it. -

They told me there was nothing out there, nothing to fear. But ... I

 stop until it gets revenge...   me. - Batman Begins

The infinite possibilities each day holds should stagger the mind. The 
sheer number of experiences I could have is uncountable, breathtaking, 
and I'm sitting here refreshing my Inbox. We live trapped in loops. 
Reliving a few days over and over, and we envision only a handful of 
paths laid out ahead of us. We see the same things each day, we respond 
the same way, we think the same thoughts, each day a slight variation on
 the last. Every moment smoothly following the gentle curves of societal
 norms. We act like if we just get through today, tomorrow our dreams 
will come back to us. And no, I don't have all the answers. I don't know
 how to jolt myself into seeing what each moment could become. But I do 
know one thing: The solution doesn't involve watering down my every 
little idea and creative impulse for the sake of some day easing my fit 
into a mold. It doesn't involve tempering my life to better fit 
someone's expectations. It doesn't involve constantly holding back for 
fear of shaking things up. -xkcd.com

The truth is, when all is said and done, one does not teach a subject, 
one teaches a student how to learn it. Teaching may look like 
administering a dose, but even a dose must be worked on by the body if 
it is to cure. Each individual must cure his or her own ignorance.

Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and

I think that this is the first time I am meeting most of you. But to me,
 whether it is an old friend or new friend, there's not much difference 
anyway, because I always believe we are the same; we are all human 
beings. Of course, there may be differences in our cultural background 
or way of life, there may be differences in our faith, or we may be of a
 different color, but we are human beings, consisting of the human body 
and the human mind. Our physical structure is the same, and our mind and
 our emotional nature are also the same. Whenever I meet people, I 
always have the feeling that I am encountering another human being, just
 like myself. I find it is much easier to communicate with others on 
that level. If we emphasize specific characteristics, like I am Tibetan 
or I am Buddhist, then there are differences. But those things are 
secondary. If we can leave the differences aside, I think we can easily 
communicate, exchange ideas, and share experiences. - Dalai Lama
<br><br>
genuine compassion is based on the rationale that all human beings have 
an innate desire to be happy and overcome suffering, just like myself.  
And, just like myself, they have the natural right to fulfill this 
fundamental aspiration.  On the basis of the recognition of these 
equality and commonality, you develop a sense of affinity and closeness 
with others. - Dalai Lama

Within the body there are billions of different particles. Similarly, 
there are many different thoughts and a variety of states of mind. It is
 wise to take a close look into the world of your mind and to make the

recognize the value of good states of mind, you can increase or foster 
them. - Dalai Lama

Simplicity is the soul of efficiency. - A. Freeman (in The Eye of Osiris) 
<br><br>
There is a race between the increasing complexity of the systems we 
build and our ability to develop intellectual tools for understanding 
their complexity. If the race is won by our tools, then systems will 
eventually become easier to use and more reliable. If not, they will 
continue to become harder to use and less reliable for all but a 
relatively small set of common tasks. Given how hard thinking is, if 
those intellectual tools are to succeed, they will have to substitute 
calculation for thought. - L. Lamport
<br><br>
Another effective [debugging] technique is to explain your code to 
someone else. This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself. 
Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an 
embarrassed Never mind, I see what's wrong. Sorry to bother you. This 
works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners. 
One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk.

The computer programmer ... is a creator of universes for which he alone
 is the lawgiver ... universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be 
created in the form of computer programs. Moreover ... systems so 
formulated and elaborated act out their programmed scripts. They 
compliantly obey their laws and vividly exhibit their obedient behavior.

answers to all the great questions of the universe.

1. It is necessary for me to be extremely frugal for some time, till I have paid what I owe.<br>
2. To endeavor to speak truth in every instance; to give nobody 
expectations that are not likely to be answered, but aim at sincerity in
 every word and action - the most amiable excellence in a rational 
being.<br>
3. To apply myself industriously to whatever business I take in hand, 
and not divert my mind from my business by any foolish project of 
suddenly growing rich; for industry and patience are the surest means of
 plenty.<br>
4. I resolve to speak ill of no man whatever.<br>
- Benjamin Franklin's Plan for Future Conduct, 1726
<br><br>
Truth and sincerity have a certain distinguishing native luster about 
them which cannot be perfectly counterfeited; they are like fire and 
flame, that cannot be painted. -Benjamin Franklin
<br><br>
If two persons equal in judgement play for a considerable sum, he that 
loves money most shall lose; his anxiety for the success of the game 
confounds him. - Benjamin Franklin
<br><br>
To decide whether or not he should take money for work that violated his
 principles, Benjamin Franklin performed a test: "To determine whether I
 should publish it or not, I went home in the evening, purchased a 
twopenny loaf at the baker's, and with the water from the pump made my 
supper; I then wrapped myself up in my great-coat, and laid down on the 
floor and slept till morning, when, on another loaf and a mug of water, I
 made my breakfast. From this regimen I feel no inconvenience whatever. 
Finding I can live in this manner, I formed a determination never to 
prostitute my press to the purposes of corruption and abuse of this kind
 for the sake of gaining a more comfortable subsistence."

Franklin was the perfect person to turn electricity from a parlor trick 
into a science. That task demanded not a mathematical or theoretical 
scholar, but instead a clever and ingenious person who had the curiosity
 to perform practical experiments, plus enough mechanical talent and 
time to tinker with a lot of contraptions. - Walter Isaacson, Benjamin 
Franklin An American Life, Page 134
<br><br>
Let the experiment be made. - Benjamin Franklin
<br><br>
Learn all that is learnable.
<br><br>
This attitude, and his lack of grounding in theoretical math and 
physics, is why Franklin, ingenious as he was, was no Galileo or Newton.
 He was a practical experimenter more than a systematic theorist. .. 
Franklin's scientific work was distinguished less for its abstract 
theoretical sophistication than for its focus on finding out facts and 
putting them to use. - Walter Isaacson, Benjamin Franklin An American 
Life, Page 144

it is now discovered and demonstrated, both here and in Europe, that the
 Electrical Fire is a real Element, or Species of Matter, not created by
 the Friction, but collected only.<br>
 - Benjamin Franklin, Letter to Cadwallader Colden, 5 June 1747
<br><br>
In 1747, Benjamin Franklin discovered the principle of electrical charge
 conservation - an electric charge can not be created or destroyed, only
 collected. In 1750, Benjamin Franklin published an experiment proposal 
to prove lightning is electricity and collected electricity in a group 
of Leyden jars that he described as "a battery". <br>The electron was not discovered until almost 150 years later (in 1897)!

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the 
strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them 
better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, 
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;
 who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort 
without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the 
deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends 
himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph 
of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails 
while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold 
and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.  - Roosevelt

The higher we soar, the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly. -Nietzsche
<br><br>
They muddy the water, to make it seem deep. - Nietzsche

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a 
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by 
the content of their character. -Martin Luther King
<br><br>
Our security strategies have not yet caught up with the risks we are 
facing. The globalization that has swept away the barriers to the 
movement of goods, ideas and people has also swept with it barriers that
 confined and localized security threats. -ElBaradei
<br><br>
I did not hate the author of my misfortunes, per se truth and justice acquit
 me of that. I rather pitied the hard destiny to which he seemed 
condemned. But I thought with unspeakable loathing of those errors, in 
consequence of which every man is fated to be, more or less, the tyrant 
or the slave. I was astonished at the folly of my species, that they did
 not rise up as one man, and shake off chains so ignominious, and misery
 so insupportable. So far as related to myself, I resolved. And this 
resolution has never been entirely forgotten by me, to hold myself 
disengaged from this odious scene, and never fill the part either of the
 oppressor or the sufferer.
-William Godwin

Man, when perfected, is the best of animals, but when separated from law and justice, he is the worst of all. -Aristotle

In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people
 very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. -Douglas Adams

Christianity is perhaps as much indebted to its enemies, as to its 
friends, for this important service. In their indiscriminate attacks, 
whatever has been found to be untenable has been gradually abandoned, 
and I hope the attack will be continued till nothing of the wretched 
outworks be left; and then, I doubt not, a safe and impregnable 
fortress, will be sound in the center, a fortress built upon a rock, 
against which the gates of death will not prevail. -Joseph Priestley 
(discovered Oxygen)

It is error only, and not truth, that shrinks from inquiry. -Thomas Paine
<br><br>
I knew, as everyone knows, that the easiest way to attract a crowd is to
let it be known that at a given time and a given place some one is 
going to attempt something that in the event of failure will mean sudden
death. - Harry Houdini
